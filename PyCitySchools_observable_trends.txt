Observable Trends:

1. The bottom 5 and top 5 performing schools are all 'District' and 'Charter', respecitvely.
 
2. Average math and reading grades do not appear to vary significantly between grades within the same school.

3. Attending 'Charter' type schools markedly affects percentage of those who pass math, from approx 67% to approx 94%. 
The difference was less notable in reading

4. School size had a significant impact on subject passing rates (again, especially so with respect to maths). Adding school type to the
data_summary_type chart also showed that school type and size also correlated; the average Charter school was more than twice as small
as the average District school.
